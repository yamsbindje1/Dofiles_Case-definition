********************************************************************************

* Author:	NBNR
* Date:		05.03.2021

* Version control:
* 		- v1.0			NBNR		Defined D28 danger sign symptoms for all countries
*		- v1.1			NBNR		DRC: Added lethargie to symptom_sleepy
*									DRC: Added paleur cutan√©e to symptom_whitepalms
*		- *please enter changes here
*		- 				GDEO		DRC: Line 259 Removed "	|  d28_q11_27 == 1	"
*									because of wrong labeling

* Note: Use "\\KISUNDI.swisstph.ch\EPH\CARAMAL\8. Results\8.3. Analysis\8.3.1. PSS\8.3.1.0 Definitions\do-files\0_generate_testdata.do" to test code below. 

* Questions: 
*				- Vomiting everything - consider q11?
*				- Cough for 21 days or more - D28 only asks about 14 days
*				- All danger sings in all countries or only WHO + country?
